This is the material for the UDE tutorial of the conference [KI 2022](https://ki2022.gi.de/).

## Abstract

Let's merge domain-specific models with generic learning. With Julia it is easy to combine these different worlds, differential equations on the one hand and (deep) neural networks on the other. The combination is known as Universal Differential Equations, and published in the paper “Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning” by Rackauckas et al. in November 2021. This new modelling flexibility of scientific machine learning brings immense benefits to all kinds of computational sciences.

We will explain the theory behind Universal Differential Equations, including the subclass of Neural Differential Equations, why Julia is particularly suited to this, and see the power of such models in practice.

Everything is interactive and beginner-friendly, with the opportunity to recreate such state-of-the-art models live.

## Prerequisites
- it is good to have at least minimal programming experience in one language
- no knowledge of Julia is required
- knowledge of differential equations is benefitial, but not necessary, as everything will be hands-on with real code
