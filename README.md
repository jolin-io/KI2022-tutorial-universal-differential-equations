The hands-on material for the tutorial will be published here. Stay tuned.
Looking forward to an awesome UDE Julia Tutorial on [KI 2022](https://ki2022.gi.de/)!

## Prerequisites
- it is good to have at least minimal programming experience in one language
- no knowledge of Julia is required
- knowledge of differential equations is benefitial, but not necessary, as everything will be hands-on with real code
